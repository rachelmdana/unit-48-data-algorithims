Part 3 - short answer

Answer the following questions

True or false: n^2 + n is O(n^2).
    true
True or false: n^2 * n is O(n^3).
    true
True or false: n^2 + n is O(n).
    False
What’s the time complexity of the .indexOf array method?
    O(n)
What’s the time complexity of the .includes array method?
    O(n)
What’s the time complexity of the .forEach array method?
    O(n)
What’s the time complexity of the .sort array method?
    O(n*log(n))
What’s the time complexity of the .unshift array method?
    O(n)
What’s the time complexity of the .push array method?
    O(1)
What’s the time complexity of the .splice array method?
    O(n)
What’s the time complexity of the .pop array method?
    O(1)
What’s the time complexity of the Object.keys() function?
    O(n)

Bonus:
the space complextiy of the Object.keys() functions is O(n) beacuse it returns an array containg the keys of the object, and the size of the arry is directly proportional to the number of keys int he object, which can be up to 'n.
